Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
    A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available.
    An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    It's positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor, 
    instead of relative to the viewport.

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    display: inline-block 

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default.
    Block default: <div>, <p>, <header> Inline defauly: <span>, <a> Inline-Block default: <button>

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?

    margin, border, padding, and the actual content. 
    Content: content of box- text and images.
    Padding: area around content- transparent. 
    Border: border of padding and content.
    Margin: area outside border- transparent.
